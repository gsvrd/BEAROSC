This simple 8-track controller is designed for Reaper and 
serves
as an introduction for exploring the Reaper OSC protocol.

This controller uses the Default.ReaperOSC configuration 
file and does not require any plugin or extensions. 
Optionally the BEAROSC.ReaperOSC is also available with
the patterns that are not used in the controller commented-out.

It was designed to be as clear as possible.
